## **Project Title**
Looking at the effect of alcohol and tobacco consumption and other demographic factors on Infant Mortality Rates


## **Intended Final Products**
Creating a website:

* Using Plotly to create graphs comparing the different data sets
* Pages: Home, Proposal, Report, Data, Visualization, About
* Data Perform a statistical analysis of the provided data
* All graphs and results (specific comparisons stated in planned analyses)
* Github repo showcasing all our committs and work

## **The anticipated data sources**
* CDC PRAMStat Data for 2007
* Peer-reviewed journal for related work literature

## **The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges**
* Data Manipulation: To compare and contrast the different data sets
  - Compare infant mortality rate in relation to alcohol consumption
  - Compare infant mortality rate in relation to tobacco consumption
  - Compare infant mortality rate in relation to no alcohol consumption
  - Compare infant mortality rate in relation to tobacco consumption
  
* Other data points of interest
  - Effect of age, race, income levels, education levels, and intent to have a child on infant mortality rate. 
  
* Visualization: ggplots (histograms, bar graph, scatter plot, density plot) and Maps.
* Coding challenges: Plots, using patchwork to combine data sets, creating a website, and formatting for aesthetics, and creating interactive maps

## **The planned timeline**
* Planning (1st week)
  - Define the project scope and goals 
  - Plan the site structure and features
  - Assign roles and responsibilities to team members 
* Project review meeting (11.16.23)
* Data Analysis (2nd week)
  - Tidy, and combine data sets to see trends in pregnancy outcomes
  - Create plots and write interpretations
* Design the website (3rd week)
  - Create a landing page and background pages
  - wireframes and mockups 
  - Create visual designs and format aesthetics
* Finalizing (4th week)
  - Run through any coding/knitting issues
  - Ensure everything is finalized to submit and work on in-class presentation doc.
