## Project Title
* Looking at Infant Mortality Outcomes in relation to Alcohol and Tobacco Consumption


## Intended Final Products
Creating a website:

* Using Plotly to create graphs comparing the different data sets
* Pages explaining the background of substance abuse in pregnancy - alcohol consumption and cigarette use in NYC
  - CDC birth defects:https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/
* About page: brief intro about Jenna, Shina and PavPerform a statistical analysis of the provided data

* All graphs and results in a pdf (specific comparisons stated in planned analyses)
* Github repo

## The anticipated data sources
* CDC PRAMStat Data for 2007
* Peer-reviewed journal for related work literature

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
* Data Manipulation: To compare and contrast the different data sets
  - Compare infant mortality rate in relation to alcohol consumption
  - Compare infant mortality rate in relation to tobacco consumption
  - Compare infant mortality rate in relation to no alcohol consumption
  - Compare infant mortality rate in relation to tobacco consumption
  
* Other data points of interest
  - Look at contraception use 
  
* Visualization: ggplots (histograms, bar graph, scatter plot, density plot) and Maps.
* Coding challenges: Plots, using patchwork to combine data sets, creating a website, and formatting for aesthetics. 

## The planned timeline
* Planning (1st week)
  - Define the project scope and goals 
  - Plan the site structure and features
  - Assign roles and responsibilities to team members 
* Project review meeting (11.16.23)
* Data Analysis (2nd week)
  - Tidy, and combine data sets to see trends in pregnancy outcomes
  - Create plots and write interpretations
* Design the website (3rd week)
  - Create a landing page and background pages
  - wireframes and mockups 
  - Create visual designs and format aesthetics
* Finalizing (4th week)
  - Run through any coding/knitting issues
  - Ensure everything is finalized to submit and work on in-class presentation doc.
