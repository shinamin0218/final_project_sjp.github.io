Both substance abuse and maternal/infant mortality run rampant in the United States, and with the the use of the CDC 2007 PRAM Data set, we are interested in looking at the relationships between these variables. 


## Initial questions

##### Our initial research question
Is there a significant relationship between infant mortality rate and the consumption of Alcohol and Tobacco consumption?

##### How did these questions evolve over the course of the project?
Upon reviewing reviewing the 2007 CDC PRAM data set, and thoroughly understanding the data, we picked our variables of interest that we wanted to test. The data provides robust information on several important factors related to maternal and infant health outcomes. 

##### What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
Other parts of the data that interested us was also the use of contraception in the sample demographic. 


## Motivation for this Project
We are interested in looking at how pregnancy outcomes changes among mothers who drank or smoked cigarettes before conception, and comparing it to mothers who did not abuse any substances. As a group, we were collectively interested in both Maternal Child Health and Substance Abuse and this was an ideal way to combine those two interests. The demographics, social dynamics, and healthcare system in the United States provide a unique perspective on the outcomes of maternal health and substance abuse. We are interested in learning more about the relationship between substance abuse and infant mortality rates.
