<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Infant Fatality Across the US</h1>

</div>


<p>Both substance abuse and maternal/infant mortality run rampant in the
United States, and with the the use of the CDC 2007 PRAM Data set, we
are interested in looking at the relationships between these
variables.</p>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>We loaded in data from the PRAMS 2007 dataset. This dataset provided
information about many different aspects about maternal health and birth
that we were interested in addressing.</p>
<p>After loading in the data, we cleaned each dataset by removing
unecessary columns. We then filtered the responses to tailor the
dataframe to each dataset, such as removing “no” responses to if mothers
were smoking during conception to create a dataset displaying data for
mothers who were smoking during conception.</p>
<p>We used the seperate function for the “geolocation” variable by
splitting it into a longitude and latitude variable that was used in
creating our leaflet plots.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial questions</h2>
<div id="our-initial-research-question" class="section level5">
<h5>Our initial research question</h5>
<p>Is there a significant relationship between infant mortality rate and
the consumption of Alcohol and Tobacco consumption?</p>
</div>
<div id="how-did-these-questions-evolve-over-the-course-of-the-project"
class="section level5">
<h5>How did these questions evolve over the course of the project?</h5>
<p>Upon reviewing reviewing the 2007 CDC PRAM data set, and thoroughly
understanding the data, we picked our variables of interest that we
wanted to test. The data provides robust information on several
important factors related to maternal and infant health outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div
id="what-new-questions-did-you-consider-in-the-course-of-your-analysis"
class="section level5">
<h5>What new questions did you consider in the course of your
analysis?</h5>
<p>Other parts of the data that interested us was also the use of
contraception in the sample demographic.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="motivation-for-this-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation for this Project</h2>
<p>We are interested in looking at how pregnancy outcomes changes among
mothers who drank or smoked cigarettes before conception, and comparing
it to mothers who did not abuse any substances. As a group, we were
collectively interested in both Maternal Child Health and Substance
Abuse and this was an ideal way to combine those two interests. The
demographics, social dynamics, and healthcare system in the United
States provide a unique perspective on the outcomes of maternal health
and substance abuse. We are interested in learning more about the
relationship between substance abuse and infant mortality rates.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<div id="alcohol-use-during-pregnancy" class="section level5">
<h5>Alcohol use during pregnancy</h5>
<p>The negative impact of smoking during pregnancy is evident in its
direct association with adverse birth outcomes. This habit has been
linked to a range of complications, including damage to the umbilical
cord structure, an elevated risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy,
as well as an increased likelihood of low birth weight, placental
abruption, preterm birth, and heightened infant mortality rates. <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17884310/">Reference</a></p>
<p>According to Wolfe et al., within a dataset comprising 4,536,701
birth records, 1.20% exhibited diagnostic codes related to drug or
alcohol discharge (n = 54,290). The unadjusted Relative Risks (RRs) for
maternal (RR = 2.7), fetal (RR = 1.3), neonatal (RR = 2.4), and
post-neonatal (RR = 4.3) mortality were elevated among births diagnosed
with drug or alcohol-related conditions. <a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3349286/">Reference</a></p>
</div>
<div id="tobacco-use-during-pregnancy" class="section level5">
<h5>Tobacco use during pregnancy</h5>
<p>The consumption of alcohol during pregnancy has been correlated with
a spectrum of adverse birth outcomes. This includes heightened risks of
miscarriage, stillbirth, infant mortality, congenital anomalies, low
birthweight, reduced gestational age, preterm delivery, and infants
being born small for their gestational age. <a
href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19797967/">Reference</a></p>
<p>While specific data on infant mortality rates were not explicitly
provided, it is noteworthy that maternal smoking during pregnancy
constitutes a well-established risk factor for sudden unexpected infant
death (SUID). The risk of SUID more than doubled (adjusted odds ratio
[aOR] = 2.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.31–2.57) in the presence of
any maternal smoking during pregnancy. Furthermore, a twofold increase
in SUID risk was observed when comparing no smoking to smoking just 1
cigarette daily throughout pregnancy. <a

<p>The presented table summarizes total infant deaths by state, where
each row represents a distinct geographical location. The
‘location_desc’ column specifies the state, while the
‘total_infant_deaths’ column reveals the corresponding count of infant
deaths in each location. The data indicates variations in infant
mortality rates across regions, with some areas reporting higher or
lower rates than others. Notably, states like Pennsylvania exhibit lower
counts of infant deaths, whereas Alaska and Arkansas show higher counts.
Nevertheless, a majority of the data falls within the 35 to 50 range.
This summary offers a comprehensive overview of the distribution of
infant deaths across diverse geographical locations.</p>

<p>the <code>Maternal_alc_use</code> plot shows the responses to the
questions asked. From this plot, we can see that from the 3 months
before pregnancy and the last 3 months of pregnancy, about 1300 monthers
continued drinking the same or more amount of alcohol, 1200 reduced how
much they consumed alcohol, and about 700 nondrinkers resumed drinking.
It is obvious that more mothers continued drinking the same amount or
more alcohol than reducing how much they consumed.</p>

<p>The <code>maternal_tobac_plot</code> displays the questions and
responses in terms of maternal use of tobacco. The three questions we
focused on was cigarette use before, during and after conception. From
the graph, we can see that in the last 3 months of pregnancy, about 1700
individuals smoked 1-5 cigarettes a day, about 1700 smoked 6-10
cigarettes a day, and about 700 smoked 41+ a day.</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>For this analysis, we looked at the 2007 CDC PRAMS dataset. We
cleaned and analyzed the data specific to maternal substance use and
infant mortality.</p>
<p>We examined the relationship between alcohol use among mothers 3
months before conception and the 3 months before birth. We found that
1395 mothers consumed alcohol in the last 3 months of their
pregnancy.</p>
<p>We also examined the relationship between tobacco use among mothers 3
months before conception and the three months before birth. In the last
3 months of their pregnancy, about 1300 mothers reported smoking 41 or
more times a day, and a little over 1300 reported smoking 1-5 times a
day. About 1400 mothers reported smoking during the last 3 months of
their pregnancy overall. This data shows that a significantly large
portion of mothers regularly consumed tobacco during the last 3 months
of their pregnancy, which may play a contributing factor to maternal and
infant health outcomes after birth.</p>
<p>Regarding Infant Mortality, we addressed different aspects that may
have contributed to infant deaths. We analyzed the relationship between
infant deaths and maternal smoking status, whether they were a medicaid
recipient, maternal education status, and maternal age group. Regarding
maternal age, we found that mothers who were less than 18 years old had
less total infant death count than the higher age groups, with those 45
years old or higher having the largest infant mortality count. Maternal
education, medicaid recipient, and maternal intent to give birth did not
display significant results. However, these results could have been due
to issues of sampling error, other non-tested confounding factors such
as stress levels, and baseline health levels. The intersectionality of
age and race plays a huge role as social determinants of health.</p>
<p>Additionally, upon analyzing infant mortality rate in the United
States, it was found that most states had infant death rates ranging
between 40 and 48. However, there were a few outliers, such as
Pennsylvania that had 3 total infant deaths. Colorado, Illinois, New
York, NYC, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia
had the highest total infant death count of 47. It is also important to
note that New York, excluding NYC, had 47 infant deaths, and New York
City specifically had 47 infant deaths in 2007. Combined, New York had a
total of 94 deaths, providing evidence that highly urban areas may
experience higher infant death rates. However since the dataframe does
not provide city-specific data from other states, we cannot draw any
conclusions about urban populations and its relationship to infant
mortality rates.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<p>There are some limitations to interpreting the 2007 PRAMS dataset.
Upon conducting a more in depth observational analysis, we found that
the sample was not representative of the United States as a whole. There
were only 31 states surveyed out of the 50, which skews the results of
our analysis. Our variables of interest looked at income levels,
race/ethnicity, which had several gaps. For example, the race/ethnicity
category only included hispanic, white-non-hispanic and
black-non-hispanic, which is not representative of the United States
population. Additionally, the income levels were too broad which skews
the data for the participants who have an income between different
categories.</p>
<p>Overall, this study gives good insight about the status of maternal
health and infant mortality in 2007.</p>
