## Motivation for this Project
* Interested in looking at how pregnancy outcomes changes among mothers who drank or smoked cigarettes before conception, and comparing it to mothers who did not abuse any substances. As a group, we were collectively interested in both Maternal Child Health and Substance Abuse and this was an ideal way to combine those two interests. The demographics, social dynamics, and healthcare system in the United States provide a unique perspective on the outcomes of maternal health and substance abuse. We are interested in learning more about the relationship between substance abuse and infant mortality rates.
